# project-boost

A rocket piloting game.

It's a dark game. Specially made this way.

It's a unity project.

## Future Developments
Open to development. I have some cool ideas like:
- More Bullets
- More levels
- More beautiful levels
- Gameplay levels lke easy, medium, hard.
- Advanced mechanics such as controlling thrusters one by one manually instead of easy turning.
- Maybe some assets in the far future to make it look good.

## Some advertisement

This repo is not sponsorred or something. I just want to give my appreciations.

Afterall this is a toy project that is doomed to be abandoned. But I have initiated this with the  [Udemy Course](https://udemy.com/course/unitycourse2) that
I was following. Cool course. Totally suggest it (no affiliation at all). Also [Udemy](https://udemy.com) is a cool website. Please check it out.

## TODOs

- Remove big files from the repo history.

## Known issues

- Dude this project is a toy project. Evetything is an issue...
- Spelling errors in this very file.

I've always found this very hard to do. But at some point I need to remove that big audio file :/
